'<p>My goals for this was mainly to improve my CSS skills from the <a href="/2020/10/30/cportfolio.html">cPortfolio</a> Project. Also had the added bonus of being able to design something new, learning more html, markdown and how to create a static website in preparation for my next project. This is mainly for recording my own progress.</p>

<h3 id="zooming">Zooming</h3>

<p>The main issue with the CSS in cPortfolio <em>(the first time I ever used CSS)</em> was not having a div containing all the elements I wanted, and using absolute positioning for each element. As a result, whenever I zoomed out all the elements would go to the left and it resulted in a very strange looking website. Using Facebook as a reference, I decided that for this website, when zooming out I wanted all the contents of the page to still be centered. This was done by creating a containing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> with a max width and containing every other element inside that. It was a very simple fix that stopped unwanted behaviour such as expanding navigation/side bars. The main takeaway for this was that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> solves everything.</p>

<h3 id="stacking-variable-height-div-in-columns">Stacking variable height <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> in columns</h3>

<p>This was a problem that I came across while designing the <a href="/projects">Project</a> page. As I like having pictures in my posts, I had a lot of different sized <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> elements. When stacking them using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float:left</code>, I ended up with a lot of empty space depending on the elements as though you can have different sized elements, the new row will start based on the max height of the previous row. I had a few responses to this issue, the first being looking it up on stack exchange. Unfortunately for me a lot of the responses involved jQuery or some form of javascript, while others suggested to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float:left</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float:right</code> for a two columns. Another suggestion that came up was to use a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">flex-box</a> container, so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">align-items:flex-start</code> could be used. Unfortunately after rearranging all my containers, it just gave me the same result as previously using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">float:left</code>. Eventually I gave up on finding a pure CSS solution and decided to use <a href="https://masonry.desandro.com/">Masonry</a>, which required very little set-up and ended up being a very simple solution to my problem. All I had to do was define the post containers and adjust the size values until I got the design I wanted. It was a bit unfortunate that my hours of trying to improve my CSS skills ended up being solved with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> package, but I guess that knowing the limitations of CSS could be considered an improvement.</p>

<p>Although the above problem was solved easily using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code>, I had an issue with the Masonry grid being loaded before the pictures were completeley loaded, resulting in overlapping elements. The only CSS solution I could find was to set the minimum height of a post <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> however it still resulted in overlapping issues for the longer posts, as well as adding a lot of white space around smaller posts. The solution was to use the ‘imagesLoaded’ package which would wait for the images to load before creating a Masonry grid. Overall it was simple to use, however it did require learning jQuery and adding javascript to my website, which was not something I intended to use for a static website. The most helpful knowledge in jQuery would be knowing that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> retrieves an element and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$(document).ready(function(){})</code> waits for the entire page to load before running a function.</p>

<h3 id="templating">Templating</h3>
<p>After coming back to this website (with even more CSS fixes), I found out that Jekyll actually uses the same template language as Django, which made the reuse of template designs, and rewriting DRY code much easier. Previously, I knew how to access variables using the dot format, but now I can also include additional logic such as looping and cases. Other concepts such as template filters also exist in both Django and Jekyll, which allows for the inclusion of dates in my posts, which can be formatted via a filter.</p>

<h3 id="learning-how-to-use-markdown">Learning how to use Markdown</h3>
<p><em>Using a lot of help from this <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">source</a>.</em></p>

<p>Initially I wanted to go with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> posts instead of markdown, as I don’t really like the concept of having the same design for each page, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> would give me the freedom to design every page as I want it. Unfortunately that is incredibly time consuming, and Jekyll makes markdown very easy to use regardless so I may as well use it. Admittedly after the pain of using latex to write all my notes last year, markdown is comparatively much easier to use, and I realised I could still incoporate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> elements if necessary.</p>

<p>Aside from all the syntax of markdown, there are a few unusual points and workarounds I noticed when using it.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Layout of pictures</strong> <br />
  Markdown doesn’t really have a way to caption images, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;html&gt;</code> is limited in the placement of the picture. When you want to place and caption multiple pictures in a row, using a markdown table is a very easy way to display it. CSS can also be used to adjust the default table in markdown.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Nesting markdown</strong><br />
  Most of the time the order of the syntax doesn’t matter if it is applicable to the whole word, but the combination of Lists and Text Emphasis only works when list syntax (-) is before the text emphasis (*)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Requires Spacing</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Headings (#)</li>
      <li>Lists (-)</li>
      <li>New lines (require two empty spaces after a line)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="learning-bootstrap">Learning bootstrap</h3>

<p>The progression of my software development skills has been quite interesting. At first, I designed a webpage using figma, and used the figma-generated CSS code to guide my styling. This however is prone to a lot of disasters, such as absolute positioning. It also lead to a lot of unrealistic UI/UX designs, which look good in Figma, but don’t translate to usability on screen. It also makes it harder to code. I then decided to use this website to improve my CSS skills, which improved on a lot of previous problems, however still was inefficient as I usually had to create my own CSS for every element I used.</p>

<p>Then I learnt that 99% of my problems could be solved by bootstrap components, something that I was aware of but never entirely sure how to use. Turns out it is pretty easy, as the documentation has a comprehensive list of common webpage elements, and all you really need to do is copy and paste then customise. One of the most helpful things Bootstrap provides is the grid functionality, which improves the layout of a site and makes it responsive (no more off page elements). Classes such as padding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">px-2</code> makes it much easier to change CSS elements without having to update a CSS file every single time. A smart solution that I also found was to make your own CSS class with common elements you might use (eg. background colour) and just use that class in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">html</code> definition rather than changing CSS all the time.</p>

<p>My only complaint about Bootstrap that it can be a bit plain for UI/UX designs. A lot of the time you would need to override elements to have a specific design, as the default can be a bit boring.</p>
