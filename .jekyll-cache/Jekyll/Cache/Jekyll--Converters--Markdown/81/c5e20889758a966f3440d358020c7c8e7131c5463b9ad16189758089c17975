<p>Used washi paper for the cranes, 0.7 x 40mm gold eyepins and fishhook earrings.
<br /><br />
I also tested various finishes for the paper, however none of them are suitable for good long term earrings, since they tend to crack or have undesired effects on the paper. I’m unsure how to make the cranes have a glossy and waterproof finish, though resin or another plastic finish may work if applied thin enough.</p>

<p>Designed for my friend’s 21st birthday. Inspired by the sakura festival we went to in Japan, and the paper designs I had avaliable to me. She also likes a blue and pink colour scheme so the card backing also fit in with the colour palette.</p>
