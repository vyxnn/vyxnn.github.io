<p><br /></p>

<p>For this event, the main theme was a study vibe, that fit with the aesthetic of the club UniMelb Love Letters. A block, sans-serif, uppercase title font was chosen for simplicity as well as to emulate a more academic style. The graphics were mainly school or subject related objects to relate to the â€˜courseâ€™. The notepad was later used to add additional text regarding the nature of the consultations.</p>
