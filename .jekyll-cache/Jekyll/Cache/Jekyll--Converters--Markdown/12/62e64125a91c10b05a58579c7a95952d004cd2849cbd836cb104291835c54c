<p><em>Original design was an enamel badge for top fans of UMLL. Due to feedback received, it may also be adapted as a merchandise or top fan logo.</em></p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>Used Inkscape for the vector outline and coloured using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
<p>The badge design uses the â€˜Top Fanâ€™ diamond symbol from Facebook, and integrates it with elements of the Unimelb Love Letters logo. The geometric love heart design represents being a top fan of UMLL, and was designed by drawing a diamond then removing the middle section to create a heart shape. The banner that surrounds it is also a reference to the University of Melbourne logo which has â€˜Postera Crescam Laudeâ€™ written on it, conveniently providing a space to write â€˜UMLL Top Fanâ€™.</p>

<p>I had all the variations of the colour combinations, but selected what I felt the best combinations were based on the contrast. I also had an issue with merging paths on Inkscape, resulting in varying line thickness and a pointed edge on the banner and heart intersection. It was later removed for the design that was made into a badge, however it can be seen in these images.</p>

<p>I didnâ€™t know how to use Inkscape when I first designed it, so the lines were drawn freehand or by using the line option in Photoshop. I was also experimenting with colour combinations at the time, so I used the paint bucket on the freehand lines, which resulted in an incredibly pixelated image (if you zoom in).</p>

<p>One of the designs that will be turned into a hard enamel badge. All the issues have been resolved, so Iâ€™m excited to see how itâ€™ll turn out!</p>
