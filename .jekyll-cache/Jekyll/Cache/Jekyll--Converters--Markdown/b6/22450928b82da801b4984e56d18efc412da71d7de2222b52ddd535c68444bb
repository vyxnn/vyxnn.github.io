I"‰<p><em>The aim of the <a href="http://research-in-germany.org/the-future-of-work/research-networks/research-network-padero.html">PADERO</a> Project is to develop creative applications for the use of robotics in the field of  elderly care and nursing. As a German - Japanese collaboration project, the PADERO Project can help normalize the use of robotics in nursing homes, helping to solve issues such as a shortage in nursing-home workers.</em></p>

<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>The hackathon hosted by the University of Siegen (Germany) and Waseda University (Japan) consisted of deciding on a hypothetical situation in a nursing home, implementing a solution to the problem on a robot or technology of choice and then presenting the final product to a panel of judges. The issue that my group chose to approach was allowing the elderly to maintain their social and physical health. The solution implemented to this issue was creating an exercise programme using a humanoid <a href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper">Pepper</a> robot.<br />
<br /><br />
Fun fact: I actually was not aware that this was a hackathon, as my AI teacher advertised this a â€˜robotics workshopâ€™ with â€˜free foodâ€™ and he would give us permission to skip his class to attend. The first 3-4 hours were a workshop, however I was very surprised when informed that I was competing in a hackathon. I am glad that this happened however, as I previously assumed a higher level of technological competence to participate in hackathons, and it has encouraged me to participate in a lot more.</p>

<h3 id="my-role">My Role</h3>
<p>My main role in the hackathon was programming the Pepper robot, nicknamed â€˜Pepper Senseiâ€™, using â€˜Choregrapheâ€™. Choregraphe provided an interface to create different movements and actions on Pepper, and allowed us to test our solution on a virtual robot before using it on Pepper itself. In combination with my other team members, I was involved with the programming of Pepperâ€™s head, arm and finger movements, and the synchronization of those movements with verbal cues and the videos chosen by my team.</p>

<h3 id="the-issue">The Issue</h3>
<p>As the issue we wanted to tackle was the social and physical health of the elderly, we made a lot of considerations when designing and planning the exercise programme. One was ensuring that the programme would be accessible to all kinds of people in the nursing home, which influenced our decisions on the type of exercise programmes we used and how to implement them on Pepper. We decided on two types of exercise programmes: <a href="https://www.physio-pedia.com/Otago_Exercise_Programme">Otago</a>, which was designed in New Zealand to improve balance and prevent falls, and <a href="https://www.japankuru.com/en/culture/e2263.html">Rajio Taiso</a>; also known as Radio calisthenics which is a common exercise activity in Japan that uses a radio for verbal instructions. The programmes chosen also had the added benefit of appealing to both a Western and Asian audience, which was important as the project focused on being applicable in both Germany and Japan. Both programmes also targeted different areas of the body, with Otago focusing on leg muscle training and balance, while Rajio Taiso involved hand and arm movements and could be considered as a social activity in Japan.</p>

<h3 id="the-solution">The Solution</h3>
<p>For the implementation of Pepperâ€™s movements, Choregraphe provided a lot of the basic modules for Pepper. For example, having Pepper give verbal instructions was pretty simple and involved typing the phrase we wanted to say into a text to speech box. We could also create movements by physically moving Pepperâ€™s head and then recording that in Choregraphe. The main complications for those areas was the timing of the movements and ensuring that they coincided with the video and verbal cues. The most difficult and time consuming part of programming Pepperâ€™s movements was the fingers, as we could not pre-record the movement and we had to move each individual joint in the finger to form a clenching movement. The issue with this was selecting the specific angle and intensity of each joint movement, with relation to section of the hand that the finger was attached to. Most of this was done with extremely tenative trial and error as we didnâ€™t want to break Pepperâ€™s fingers with the strength chosen, and we wanted to create the correct movement.</p>

<h3 id="the-result">The Result</h3>
<p>The presentation was the final component of the hackathon, and everyone in our group who was avaliable was expected to present. Usually this would have been the most nerve wracking component for me as I spent the vast majority of my time on Pepper instead of preparing for the presentation. However, I realised that unlike the weekly speeches I had to give in my Japanese classes about completely random topics, I had the rare opportunity to be speaking in my native language about a topic I was extremely passionate in. This alleviated a lot of the concerns I did have about public speaking, and was a turning point in becoming more confident in my communication and public speaking abilities. The presentation and demonstration of our â€˜Pepper Sensei Exercise Classâ€™ ended up being the two highest scoring areas and resulted in our teamâ€™s win.</p>
