<p><em>A web application developed for my final year capstone project at the University of Melbourne. This project involved working in a team of 5 students to develop an e-Portfolio application based off our assigned clientâ€™s requirements. The intent of this application was to provide a customised platform for users to showcase their work, and allowed them to send a personalized page to prospective employers.</em></p>
