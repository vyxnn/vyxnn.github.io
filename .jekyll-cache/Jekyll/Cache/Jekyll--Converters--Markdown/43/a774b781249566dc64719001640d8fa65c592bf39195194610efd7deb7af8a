<p><em>Original design was an enamel badge for top fans of UMLL. Due to feedback received, it may also be adapted as a merchandise or top fan logo.</em></p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>
<p>Used Adobe Illustrator for outline and coloured using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
<p>The badge design uses the ‘Top Fan’ diamond symbol from Facebook, and integrates it with elements of the Unimelb Love Letters logo. The geometric love heart design represents being a top fan of UMLL, and was designed by drawing a diamond then removing the middle section to create a heart shape. The banner that surrounds it is also a reference to the University of Melbourne logo which has ‘Postera Crescam Laude’ written on it, conveniently providing a space to write ‘UMLL Top Fan’.</p>

<p>I had all the variations of the colour combinations, but selected what I felt the best combinations were based on the contrast.</p>
