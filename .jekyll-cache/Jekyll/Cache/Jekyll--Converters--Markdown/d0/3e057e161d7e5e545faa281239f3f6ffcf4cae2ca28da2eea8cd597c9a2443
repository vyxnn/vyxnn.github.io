<p>Original design was an enamel badge for top fans of UMLL.</p>

<p>Used Adobe Illustrator for outline and coloured using Adobe Photoshop.</p>

<p>The badge design uses the â€˜Top Fanâ€™ diamond symbol from Facebook, and integrates it with elements of the Unimelb Love Letters logo. The geometric love heart design represents being a top fan of UMLL, and was designed by drawing a diamond then removing the middle section to create a heart shape. The banner that surrounds it is also a reference to the University of Melbourne logo which has â€˜Postera Crescam Laudeâ€™ written on it, conveniently providing a space to write â€˜UMLL Top Fanâ€™.</p>
