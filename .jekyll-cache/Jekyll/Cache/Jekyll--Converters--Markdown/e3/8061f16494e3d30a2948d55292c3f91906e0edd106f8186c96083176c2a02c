<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>While I do have many interesting stories of being a admin of this page, writing code for the everyday functioning of the page was one of the reasons I was really interested in computing and other technological issues such as ethics, particularly regarding the impact on social media on our lives.</p>

<p>From a technological point of view, I used this page to test out a lot of the skills I developed over my studies at university. At first, I could only use excel formulas to keep track of daily submissions, as I had no technological expertise. From an introductory course, learning what a for loop and if statements were, I managed to write a very simplistic script that would move spam from our main inbox to spam when it was marked. After learning what a method was, and how to read documentation from switching to a computing major, I managed to write a script that would help automatically format posts, which removed a lot of human errors such as having typos in post numbers or forgetting to include the course/name of posts. After my capstone project, I learnt how to use APIs and could finally fully automate our process to schedule new posts to Facebook every night.</p>
