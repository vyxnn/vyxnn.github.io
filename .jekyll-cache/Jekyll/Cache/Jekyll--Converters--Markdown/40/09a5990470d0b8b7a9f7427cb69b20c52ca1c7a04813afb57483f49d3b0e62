<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>While I do have many interesting stories of being a admin of this page, writing code for the everyday functioning of the page was one of the reasons I was really interested in computing and other technological issues such as ethics, particularly regarding the impact on social media on our lives. <br />
<br />
From a technological point of view, I used this page to test out a lot of the skills I developed over my studies at university. Essentially I started with only knowledge of excel formulas, which gave the submission and posting statistics for the page (due to personal curiousity). As I progress through uni, I learnt more programming concepts, from for loops and if statements that brought me a spam filter, reading documenation and object oriented concepts which brought a formatter, and finally the knowledge of APIs which finalised the scheduler. 
<br /></p>

<p><em>Aside: This project uses google sheets, google scripts (Javascript) and Facebook APIs.</em></p>

<h3 id="automated-scheduler">Automated Scheduler</h3>
<p>The progress of this overall process can be split up into different components. Most of which, coincides with the amount of the knowledge I had each year of my Bachelors.</p>

<h3 id="spam-filter">Spam Filter</h3>
<p>In the beginning of my second year, I took an introductory course into programming, albiet from an engineers perspective. This course taught me the basics of coding, mainly focusing on basic concepts, such as a variable, loops, logic statements. While these fundamentals were basic, they provided me enough knowledge and curiosity to test out my skills and write a very simplistic spam filter. The function of this was basically you write ‘spam’ or a similar keyword next to a submission, and it would move it into a spam inbox. As you can guess, it was very simple, but borne out of necessity as we had a few spammers who liked submitting to the page. With a bit more knowledge of Google sheets in later years, I was also able to automate this process so that repeated posts or keywords can be automatically marked as spam, however for the quality of submission on the page, the main spam detection is still manual. As I am currently undertaking an masters in AI, I would like to explore the concept of automatically being able to remove spam posts as well.</p>

<h3 id="statistics">Statistics</h3>
<p>The first year of my undergraduate degree, I had 0 technical knowledge. All I had was excel, which allowed me to set up some simple formulas which counted how many submissions we received per day, and how many submissions we posted. The fundamental set up of the formulas have not changed, however most changes that have been made over the years is display (colour coding and graphical) and efficiency. 
<br /><br />
For example: 
<br /><br />
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ArrayFormula(COUNTIF(query(split('Form Responses 1'!A:A," "),"Select Col1"), CONCAT(D3, " December 2021")))</code>
<br /><br /></p>

<p>The current formula only requires one formula to be created for each month as it can be dragged, and the month and year parameters to be updated when necessary. Previously, I would have to copy and paste the formula for each day, as it was not draggable and I needed to update the days manually.
<br /><br /></p>

<p>At first, I could only use excel formulas to keep track of daily submissions, as I had no technological expertise. From an introductory course, learning what a for loop and if statements were, I managed to write a very simplistic script that would move spam from our main inbox to spam when it was marked. After learning what a method was, and how to read documentation from switching to a computing major, I managed to write a script that would help automatically format posts, which removed a lot of human errors such as having typos in post numbers or forgetting to include the course/name of posts. After my capstone project, I learnt how to use APIs and could finally fully automate our process to schedule new posts to Facebook every night.</p>
