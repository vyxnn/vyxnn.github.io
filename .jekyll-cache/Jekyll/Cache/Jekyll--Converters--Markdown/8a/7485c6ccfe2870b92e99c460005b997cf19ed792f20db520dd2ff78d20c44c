<p><em>The aim of the <a href="http://research-in-germany.org/the-future-of-work/research-networks/research-network-padero.html">PADERO</a> Project is to develop creative applications for the use of robotics in the field of  elderly care and nursing. As a German - Japanese collaboration project, the PADERO Project can help normalize the use of robotics in nursing homes, helping to solve issues such as a shortage in nursing-home workers.</em></p>

<p>The hackathon hosted by the University of Siegen (Germany) and Waseda University (Japan) consisted of deciding on a hypothetical situation in a nursing home, implementing a solution to the problem on a robot or technology of choice and then presenting the final product to a panel of judges.<br />
The issue that my group chose to approach was allowing the elderly to maintain their social and physical health. The solution implemented to this issue was creating an exercise programme using a <a href="https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/pepper">Pepper</a> robot.</p>
