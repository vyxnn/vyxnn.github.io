<p>The theme of the class was Memento Mori, and so we were provided with a variety of skulls and other props to create a painting relevant to the theme. In particular I liked the composition I created only one skull was used, however it was surrounded by mirrors, which gave the illusion that there were more skulls than was actually used.</p>
