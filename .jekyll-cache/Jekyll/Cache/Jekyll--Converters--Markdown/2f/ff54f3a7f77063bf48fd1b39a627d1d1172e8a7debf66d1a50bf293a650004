<h3 id="about">About</h3>
<p>While I do have many interesting stories of being a admin of this page, writing code for the everyday functioning of the page was one of the reasons I was really interested in computing and other technological issues such as ethics, particularly regarding the impact on social media on our lives. <br />
<br />
From a technological point of view, I used this page to test out a lot of the skills I developed over my studies at university. Essentially I started with only knowledge of excel formulas, which gave the submission and posting statistics for the page (due to personal curiousity). As I progress through uni, I learnt more programming concepts, from for loops and if statements that brought me a spam filter, reading documenation and object oriented concepts which brought a formatter, and finally the knowledge of APIs which finalised the scheduler.</p>

<p>The progress of this overall process can be split up into the different semesters as I progressed into my Bachelors. <br />

<h4 id="statistics">Statistics</h4>
<p>The first year of my undergraduate degree, I had 0 technical knowledge. All I had was excel, which allowed me to set up some simple formulas which counted how many submissions we received per day, and how many submissions we posted.</p>

<p>At first, I could only use excel formulas to keep track of daily submissions, as I had no technological expertise. From an introductory course, learning what a for loop and if statements were, I managed to write a very simplistic script that would move spam from our main inbox to spam when it was marked. After learning what a method was, and how to read documentation from switching to a computing major, I managed to write a script that would help automatically format posts, which removed a lot of human errors such as having typos in post numbers or forgetting to include the course/name of posts. After my capstone project, I learnt how to use APIs and could finally fully automate our process to schedule new posts to Facebook every night.</p>
