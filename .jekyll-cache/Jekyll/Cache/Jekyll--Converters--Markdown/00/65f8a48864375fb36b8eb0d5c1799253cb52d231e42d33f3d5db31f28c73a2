<p>Used washi paper for the cranes, 0.7 x 40mm gold eyepins and fishhook earrings. 
I tested various finishes for the paper, however none of them are suitable for good long term earrings, since they tend to crack or have undesired effects on the paper. Iâ€™m unsure how to make the cranes have a glossy and waterproof finish, however I imagine itâ€™s probably an expensive solution.</p>

      <td>Designed for my friendâ€™s 21st birthday. Inspired by the sakura festival we went to in Japan, and the paper designs I had avaliable to me. She also likes a blue and pink colour scheme so the card backing also fit in with the colour palette.</td>
