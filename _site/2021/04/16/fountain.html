                <p><em>A web application developed for the 2021 Codebrew Hackathon (Annual Hackathon of Unimelb’s Computing Society). We selected the Social Good track and created a website using React and Node.js. The entire Hackathon was completed in 48 hours, and we were selected to present at the finals, where we were the runners up in our category.</em></p>

<h3 id="theme">Theme</h3>
<p>We were in the ‘Social Good’ track and created an online platform for those in need to connect to those who are able to help. For example, a family struggling could create a post asking for a service, such as food donation or a plumber, and someone who is able to help would respond. Conversely, people can also offer a service such as free/cheap baby sitting, and interested parties can also get in contact. We also incorporated a donation feature in case people couldn’t offer a specific service but still wanted to contribute, however that did detract from the main intention we were attempting to convey to judges, as we received a comment that our website was basically GoFundMe, so we emphasised the services a lot more in our final presentation.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>
<p>The process of building this application was similar to previous React/Node.js projects I’ve created in the past, however as we had only 2 days, we allocated each member a task. My task was essentially building the frontend, and involved a lot of the appearance, designing and set up of all routes/states in React. We unfortunately weren’t able to complete the backend in such a short amount of time, so we ended up using prepared JSON data for our presentation. This however wasn’t a major issue as it showcased all the functionality required, and a judge mentioned how hackathons are focused a lot on presentations and the concept rather than code quality. As it was my first software development hackathon, it was very eye-opening to find how the process works, and perhaps focusing more on how the website was presented, and which functionality is absolutely necessary for display would have improved our overall pitch.</p>

<h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3>
<p>We had two rounds of judging, one where submitted a video demonstrating our website, and the final round where the top 2 teams of each category would present. The video submission was very straightforward, and was just a walkthough of the website, though I did have some microphone issues. In all honesty, we were not expecting to go into the final round, as we did not have a working backend, however we ended up being selected! This was a minor issue however, as I was at work (in my internship), and other team members were also preoccupied with work/university. As a result, we did not have a lot of time to prepare, however we did end up delivering a decent final pitch.</p>

<p><br /><br />
The final pitch was more focused on the concept and viability of the website in the ‘real-world’. Aside from the concept itself, we also had to discuss potential issues, funding and how to extend the application beyond a demonstration. This did spark some interesting discussion from judges, particularly around online security, as we are effectively connecting strangers online, the one asking for help likely being in a vulnerable position. While some points, such as adding identification, a reporting system, and allowing people to chat before meeting up were addressed in our presentation, the judges also provided valuable questions and considerations to make. One was limiting interactions to geographical locations, for instance a suburb, which would help foster a sense of community and make people more likely to ask or provide help when it is in a neighbourhood rather than across the country. Another was more stronger regulation of the donation system, such as having a verified account/proof.</p>

<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>Overall I felt the experience was very valuable and great a creating an idea that I could develop further in the future. In particular, I feel like the conversations with the judges about how to make the application viable when launched was very useful and interesting, and raised a lot of points to consider in the future. I also enjoyed looking at other pitches and seeing how other people decided to identify and solve a problem. I also gained valuable insight into the conduct of a hackathon (computing specific) and how to better utilise the time and sell a pitch (the presentation also helped improve my zoom public speaking skills as well).</p>
