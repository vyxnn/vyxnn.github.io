                                <p> The Policy Library is a redevelopment of the previous 10 year old Java site. Improvements in the newly developed Policy Library is a simplified workflow that improves the efficiency of policy maintenance, an updated and more modern interface, and the introduction of new features. </p> <p> This was developed by the DevOps and Policy team at the University of Melbourne. It was built using the Django Framework, a MSSQL database, and a CI/CD pipeline in Gitlab for deployment. </p>

                                   <p> A website developed as part of my university's hackathon (CISSA's Codebrew). We were selected to present at the finals, and were runners up in our category. </p> <p> This prototype was built using React, Node.js and MongoDB in 48 hours. The idea of the application is that people in need of services (such as food, clothes, books) can ask for help. People willing to provide donations could then contact those in need. It was inspired by stories of goodwill during the COVID pandemic such as restaurants offering free food to anyone who needed it. </p>

                                 <p> A web application developed as part of my final year capstone project. As a team of 5 students, we created an e-Portfolio application based on our assigned client's requirements. </p> <p> This was built using React, Node.js, MongoDB and Heroku. This application allows users to showcase their work, and create customised pages that can be sent to an employer based on their requirements. Using our application, they can select which content they want displayed, and send a unique link to different employers depending on context. </p>

                                 <p> Pepper Sensei is a social exercise programme that is delivered by a humanoid Pepper robot. It won first place in the PADERO Hackathon. I participated in this hackathon during my exchange at Waseda University (Tokyo, Japan). </p> <p> The issue that we chose to tackle was the physical and social health of those in elderly homes. The programme involved two main types of exercise, Otago and Rajio Taiso. Various accessibility features, such as visual. mobile and verbal aids were also incoporated into our programme to account for issues that elderly people develop. </p>
