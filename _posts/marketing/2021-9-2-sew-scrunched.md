### Sew Scrunched Sponsorship Ad
<br>

Sew Scrunched's products were mainly focused on scrunchies with some miscellaneous hair accessories and keychains. While their instagram featured a variety of designs, I found that a lot of them looked too random when combined into one graphic. As a result I decided to stick to one colour theme, initially planning for pink to match our logos but later switching to blue to showcase a wider variety of their products. The end combination of images ended up giving a very beachy and natural vibe, which ended up working quite well. 
<br>
The hexagonal composition of this graphic was a template from Canva, however it was well suited to showcase the scrunchies, as the round and irregular shape of the scrunchies contrasted with the hard straight edges of the hexagons. The layout and white background also contributed to make the final graphic look very clean. I really liked how this graphic turned out, however I would make the logos a little smaller or match the size of the hexagons, just because they look a little out of place.
