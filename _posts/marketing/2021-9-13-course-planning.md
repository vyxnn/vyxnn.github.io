### UMLL Course Planning Graphic
<br>

For this event, the main theme was a study vibe, that fit with the aesthetic of the club UniMelb Love Letters. A block, sans-serif, uppercase title font was chosen for simplicity as well as to emulate a more academic style. The graphics were mainly school or subject related objects to relate to the 'course'. The notepad was later used to add additional text regarding the nature of the consultations.
