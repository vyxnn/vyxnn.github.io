### Akuru Sponsorship Ad
<br>
 
For Akuru, I wanted to highlight the personalised bags that they sold. The bags themselves usually tend to be one colour, so I chose images from their social media with additional elements that would brighten up the graphic, as well as match their overall aesthetic. The pink background image matched their logo, and the two other images with the wine and lime colours brought a pastel and fresh vibe. 
<br><br>
The instagram ad is posted in the form of a story, these tend to be quite short, so I decided to place more emphasis on the images and cut down the words in the graphic. I decided to choose a tan colour with a contrasting brown font for easier readability, and focused on the brand, images and discount.
