# Top Fan Badge Design  

*Original design was an enamel badge for top fans of UMLL. Due to feedback received, it may also be adapted as a merchandise or top fan logo.*  

### Tools 
Used Inkscape for the vector outline and coloured using Adobe Photoshop.   

### Inspiration
The badge design uses the 'Top Fan' diamond symbol from Facebook, and integrates it with elements of the Unimelb Love Letters logo. The geometric love heart design represents being a top fan of UMLL, and was designed by drawing a diamond then removing the middle section to create a heart shape. The banner that surrounds it is also a reference to the University of Melbourne logo which has 'Postera Crescam Laude' written on it, conveniently providing a space to write 'UMLL Top Fan'.

### Designs  

I had all the variations of the colour combinations, but selected what I felt the best combinations were based on the contrast. I also had an issue with merging paths on Inkscape, resulting in varying line thickness and a pointed edge on the banner and heart intersection. It was later removed for the design that was made into a badge, however it can be seen in these images.

### Bonus Designs  

I didn't know how to use Inkscape when I first designed it, so the lines were drawn freehand or by using the line option in Photoshop. I was also experimenting with colour combinations at the time, so I used the paint bucket on the freehand lines, which resulted in an incredibly pixelated image (if you zoom in).

One of the designs that will be turned into a hard enamel badge. All the issues have been resolved, so I'm excited to see how it'll turn out!
