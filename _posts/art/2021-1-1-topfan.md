*Original design was an enamel badge for top fans of UMLL. Due to feedback received, it may also be adapted as a merchandise or top fan logo.*  

### Tools 
Used Inkscape for the vector outline and coloured using Adobe Photoshop.   

### Inspiration
The badge design uses the 'Top Fan' diamond symbol from Facebook, and integrates it with elements of the Unimelb Love Letters logo. The geometric love heart design represents being a top fan of UMLL, and was designed by drawing a diamond then removing the middle section to create a heart shape. The banner that surrounds it is also a reference to the University of Melbourne logo which has 'Postera Crescam Laude' written on it, conveniently providing a space to write 'UMLL Top Fan'.

### Designs  

I had all the variations of the colour combinations, but selected what I felt the best combinations were based on the contrast. I also had an issue with merging paths on Inkscape, resulting in varying line thickness and a pointed edge on the banner and heart intersection. It was later removed for the design that was made into a badge, however it can be seen in these images.

### Bonus Designs  

I didn't know how to use Inkscape when I first designed it, so the lines were drawn freehand or by using the line option in Photoshop. I was also experimenting with colour combinations at the time, so I used the paint bucket on the freehand lines, which resulted in an incredibly pixelated image (if you zoom in).

Two of the designs that will be turned into a hard enamel badge. All the issues have been resolved, so I'm excited to see how it'll turn out! A survey was done to determine the most popular designs. As we had to limit the metal finish to one colour (either gold or silver), the silver and blue combination was not chosen though it was also popular.

| *Final Designs* |  

<br>
The final badges were a little thinner than I expected, and so did not have as accurate details as the original design (seen in the font). However it turned out quite well, and I'm always excited when I see someone wearing one on campus.
