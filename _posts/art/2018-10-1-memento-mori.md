*A painting I completed as part of my still life painting class. Memento Mori means 'Remember that you will die' in Latin, and often incorporates a lot of symbolism regarding death, such as human skulls.*

### Tools 
Brown, Blue and White acrylic paint was used to create the grey tones in the painting. Different sized kaerell brushes, a spatula and paper canvas was used for the painting materials. 

### Inspiration
The theme of the class was Memento Mori, and so we were provided with a variety of skulls and other props to create a painting relevant to the theme. In particular I liked the composition I created only one skull was used, however it was surrounded by mirrors, which gave the illusion that there were more skulls than was actually used. The skull facing the mirror was also reminiscent of a common perception of a human looking into a mirror to re-evaluate their life, a skull looking into a mirror is more omnious and a reminder that it is dead.
