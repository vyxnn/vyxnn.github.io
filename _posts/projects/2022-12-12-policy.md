*An application developed for the University of Melbourne's Policy Team by the DevOps Team. We won the 'OneTeam' award for this application, and received interest from outside parties such as the University of Sydney and ANZ regarding the new Policy Library.*

### DevOps Process 
The process we followed was based on an Agile Development process, with recurring meetings with the business (Policy Team) for requirements, and a repeated development process where we build features and adjust according to feedback from tests and users. 

1. Requirements 
2. Development 
3. Testing 
4. User Acceptance Testing 
5. Deployment  

#### Requirements
This stage involved liaising with the business on a weekly basis for necessary requirements and features to be included in the Policy Library. The majority of features were necessary ones that involved retaining existing functionality from the previous application. There were also a number of improvements made to the workflow in this process, that were collaboratively determined by the business outlining an ideal scenario, and the developers negotiating this based on technical limitations. Other features were considered less important or 'nice-to-have' and were prioritized to be completed after the necessary functions, or as a different phase if it was not necessary for deployment. 

This was repeated on a weekly basis, and also allowed us to demo new features or ask for clarification on a ticket. As a result the business receives an update on the progress of development, and we are able to handle potential blockers.

#### Development 
From the requirements list, we selected a few tickets/features to work on every week. This stage is the 'programming' one, so a lot of the work I was already experienced with, having developed Django Applications in the past. One area that I focused on improving more on, was the UI/UX component of the application, as the usability of the previous library was a point of pain for the business. 

#### Testing
For this stage, we had a dedicated tester in our team who verified the functionality defined in the requirements. This was particularly helpful as I may know the intended usage of a feature, and test accordingly, but someone else may run into issues as they may have a different approach. As a result, a lot of edge or hidden cases were able to be identified and resolved accordingly. 

#### User Acceptance Testing 
After a feature is tested, the user is given a UAT environment to confirm that the feature is according to their expectations. Aside from finding other use cases where behaviour may not be expected, this also allowed us to rework any features that they are not satisfied with prior to deployment. There is usually a disconnect with discussing a requirement and seeing it in action, so it was helpful to resolve these issues beforehand. 

Once the feature is approved by the business, it is marked as ready for deployment. 

#### Deployment 
The first deployment involved a lot of preparation, as we had to set a content freeze on the previous application and migrate all existing data to the new application. While our CI/CD pipeline tends to handle deployment, there were also a number of tasks that could only be done on the day, such as switching the production URL and setting up OKTA SSO, and decommissioning the old application. 

### Upload Feature
One of features implemented was a document upload and download process. Originally I decided on two python packages to use, one that would convert from Word to HTML, and back from HTML to Word. For the most part, this worked for the format of existing policies and was able to retain most of the formatting with some edits to the packages. 

However the issue arose, when the business wanted to change the format of lists. The old application required the format of lists to be manually numbered and indented, however it was more efficient to convert to a Word Document List format, which would save them the time of renumbering and formatting a list whenever something new was to be added. While this seems like a simple requirement, it ended up being more complex than necessary as the `1.1` list format is not a default `HTML` element. This meant that it was incompatible with the python and javascript packages, CKEditor and the display of the site. 

The issue was resolved by using the Microsoft Office API. This API produces the same output as if you were to 'save as HTML' in word, so worked well for our workflow. One issue that the API was that could only be run on Windows OS, whereas we host the application on Docker which uses Linux. To overcome this issue, a senior developer created a microservice that functions as an API, all the application had to do was pass the document to the microservice, and it would return a HTML output. The download functionality was also simple, as we just needed to store the original document and return it to the user when required. 

Another issue that arose was that the Microsoft Office API tended to generate CSS that had a very broad scope, for example they would make all links `<a>` a certain colour, rather than just a specific class. Unfortunately, we could not discard their CSS, as it handled important display points, such as indentation. This tended to override our own styling, and so additional CSS had to be written to resolve this problem.  

The achieved workflow was: 
1. Word Docx to HTML (Upload)
2. HTML Website Display 
3. HTML to Word Docx (Download)

### UI/UX
In previous projects I usually had university branded components to use, so I never had much creative freedom for the UI aside from the placement of elements. In this library, I had a lot more freedom as we used Bootstrap for our components. For the formatting of the site, I retained a similar placement of information but with more updated styling. I also focused on improving usability of the library to be compatible with mobile.
