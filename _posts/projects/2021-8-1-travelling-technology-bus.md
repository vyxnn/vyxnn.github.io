*A website developed as part of my Software Process and Management subject (SWEN90016). The physical development of the application was only worth 2/30 points, the project instead had a heavy emphasis on documentation and following a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Django was used to minimize the programming resources required, as most members having experience in Django, Python or CSS/HTML components.*

### Case Study 
The case study was of a client who wanted to create a booking website for schools to 'schedule' the Travelling Technology Bus (TTB) to visit them. The premise was very similar to 'Healthy Harold' which used to visit primary schools, but the focus was on educating primary and high school students about STEM and it's applications. The main processes that were required were a login for schools and administrators, school registration, admin scheduling, and confirmation emails for each action. 

### Development 
The development process was relatively straightforward, as one of the developers experienced with Django, I was able to use a lot of Django's inbuilt functionality like setting up forms using models, and it's own login and authentication system quite easily. Another team member also worked on the email system which I've never used before, however also turned out to be simplier than expected as it used a python package to send mail. While there were 3 different people working on the code, aside from integrating it all together, there were very few issues during this process. The main pages of the website can be seen below.

### Documentation 
There was a lot of documentation for this project, which comprised of the majority of our mark. We were required to create a Project Management Plan for this assignment, and add in relevant documentation consistent with the SDLC chosen. As we followed a 'Waterfall' SDLC instead of Agile, we were required do extensive planning into the requirements, design, development and testing stages. This resulted in our final report being over 100+ pages, where a lot of that was attributed to documentation. Personally, the time spent developing the application took much less than the time spent on planning, documenting and reviewing the report. Planning the database structure and website required did make the initial setup easier, but other areas such as risk planning was a lot more difficult to do in advance, given the general lack of experience in projects from students. We had a relatively tight schedule, that often needed to be revised due to student commitments, and while we did complete the work, it was not as week-to-week as initially planned. While following a formal process was an interesting experience, as a student it was a little difficult to extensively predict issues and ensure a consistent times dedicated to working on this specific project. Regardless of the choice in SDLC, we did end up doing well on the project, and as I had only used Agile processes in the past, learning how a formal approach was a worthwhile experience. 

### Overall 
While this project didn't focus much on programming, it was good to experiment a little more with some common features in Django and Python, such as the authentication system and email functionality. It was also beneficial to learn a bit more about processes that industry projects usually follow, and apply that to our own project (though we were drowning in paperwork towards the deadline).
